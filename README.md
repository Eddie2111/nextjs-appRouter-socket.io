# This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) nested project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org) with [Socket.IO](https://socket.io).

## Overview

This template demonstrates how to implement socket io with nodeJS for nextJS.
NextJS is set up with app router, typescript and tailwindCSS.
NodeJS is set up with http server and socket io.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run chat:dev
# or
yarn chat:dev
# or
pnpm chat:dev
# or
bun chat:dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the pages by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

You can start editing the server side chatting systems by modifying `server/index.js`. The server autostarts when a change is made by the hot reloader [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon).

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
